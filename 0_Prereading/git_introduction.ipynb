    "\n",
    "Git is a version control system used to track changes in files over time. It allows you to save snapshots of your work, revisit previous versions, and collaborate with others safely. Git is widely used in software development, data science, finance, and many other technical fields. Git helps you understand what changed in your files, when it changed, and why it changed."

    "### Step 1: Open the terminal and check if Git is installed\n",
    "Type this exactly and press Enter:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If git is installed, you'll see something like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git version 2.44.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If successfully installed, you can skip to step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Git manually\n",
    "Go to: https://git-scm.com/, and click download for your respective machine, then open the installer and click next on everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Tell Git who you are\n",
    "Git needs to know who is making changes, so make the following changes:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "$ git config --global user.email \"youremail@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "user.name=Your Name\n",
    "user.email=youremail@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Create a GitHub account\n",
    "Go to: https://github.com, and sign up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Connecting your local machine to GitHub\n",
    "Think of Git as a version control tool on your computer, and GitHub a website that store Git repositories online. Connecting them lets you back up your code, work across devices and collaborate with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5a: Set up SSH authentication\n",
    "SSH is a secure key that proves that this laptop is yours, and creates a private channel for GitHub to talk to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "First check if you already have an SSH key\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls ~/.ssh\n",
    "```\n",
    "and if you see files like this:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "id_ed25519\n",
    "id_ed25519.pub\n",
    "```\n",
    "skip to Step 5c.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5b: \n",
    "Paste the text below, replacing the email used in the example with your GitHub email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -C \"email@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then press Enter to accept the default preferences.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5c:\n",
    "The contents of your SSH key needs to be copied such that it can be pasted into GitHub. Type the following commands into your terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/.ssh\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "$ cat [Enter file name that ends in .pub]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the contents of the output which should end in your email.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5d:\n",
    "Now the final step is to connect to GitHub, which you can do via going to settings -> SSH and GPG Keys --> New SSH key. Add a title, leave default key type, and then paste the key you copied from Step 5c."
