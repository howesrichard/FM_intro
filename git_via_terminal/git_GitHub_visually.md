# A visual explanation of git and GitHub

## What is git
Git is a version controls system.   It tracks changes to files over time allowing you to:
- Save snapshots (commits) of your project at any point
- Compare commits to see what's changed
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- See who changed what and when
- Work on multiple features simultaneously (branches)
- Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work

### Commits are a series of snapshots
