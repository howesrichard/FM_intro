    "# FINMA FM Equity Research Exercise\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "You are an equity research analyst and you have been tasked with developing and implementing a program that produces an equity research report as a pdf file for an assigned company in the ASX200. As a group, you will be randomly assigned a ticker to report on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One team member will be the leader, who will create a new **private** GitHub repo and invite team members as collaborators, with each team member creating a different enhancement to the program which will become included in the research report pdf. In other words, the team should allocate each section of the report to a single member. Do not set your repo to public visibility at any time, before or after submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your blank repo create a new notebook (.ipynb) file named _analyst\\_report.ipynb_. You will develop your main program inside this notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "The program should produce an attractive and well-formatted report. The features that your program can have, along with the marks assigned for each feature are:\n",
    "- Create a pdf file of the final research report\n",
    "- Key ratios and financial metrics informed through the use of an API, and computed in functions that have been created, saved into, and imported from a .py file\n",
    "- Include commentary imported from a .txt file\n",
    "- An extract from a DCF model built in Excel\n",
    "- A chart showing price history for the stock, historical price targets of the research (taken from a CSV file), and the history of the ASX200\n",
    "- A relevant image or table scraped from a website for the company\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of the task is on your ability to use Python and GitHub collaboratively, not on your financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure all of your files are in a single folder. This folder should include:\n",
    "  - Your main notebook file named analyst_report.ipynb.\n",
    "  - Any .py files you used to store functions for importing to your main program.\n",
    "  - Any .txt or .csv files that your main program needs to draw from.\n",
    "  - The .xlsx file that contains your DCF analysis.\n",
    "  - Any output files generated by running your program, including the final pdf equity report.\n"
