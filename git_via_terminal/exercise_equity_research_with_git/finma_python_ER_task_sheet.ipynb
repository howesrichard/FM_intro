    "\n",
    "You are a 3-person equity research analyst team and you have been tasked with developing and implementing a program that produces an equity research report as a pdf file for a company selected by the user of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "One team member will be the leader, who will:\n",
    "- create a new **private** GitHub repo called \"finma_EquityAnalyst_reportGen\" \n",
    "- invite 2 team members as collaborators\n",
    "- copy the EAR_generator.ipynb from howesrichard/finma_FM_working into the new repo\n",
    "- create a folder called \"assets\"\n",
    "- push these changes to the main branch of the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "The second team member will be responsible for the commentary that goes into the report:\n",
    "- create a new branch on the leader/finma_EquityAnalyst_reportGen repo called \"Commentary_function\"\n",
    "- create 3 text files named BHP.txt, CBA.txt, and GYG.txt, in the assets folder, which each contains a paragraph of text which will form the commentary that will get included into the final research report;\n",
    "- create a new python file called \"commentary.py\" containing a function which returns a paragraph of commentary depending on the argument of the function which will the the three letter stock symbol \n",
    "- the function will open the appropriate text file read the text and return this text as the return value of the function\n",
    "- once you are happy with you commentary.py file and your .txt files:\n",
    "  - push your committed changes to the Commentary_funciton branch\n",
    "  - create a pull request to merge the Commentary_function branch onto the main branch \n",
    "\n",
    "The third team member will be responsible for creating three historical stock price charts using the matplotlib library.\n",
    "- create a new branch on the leader/finma_EquityAnalyst_reportGen repo called \"Charts\"\n",
    "- create a jupyter notebook that:\n",
    "  - imports the relevant libraries\n",
    "  - gets stock price data from a csv file that you create or, if you are feeling adventurous, and can figure out how to do it, from data you call from the yfinance API\n",
